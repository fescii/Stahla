- Ensure geocoding API is enabled

### Log Monitoring

System events are logged for troubleshooting. Configure Logfire token for advanced monitoring and alerting.

## Security Considerations

- Secure `.env` file and never expose API keys
- Use HTTPS in production deployments
- Implement regular API key rotation
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- Configure proper firewall rules for database access

## Support and Maintenance

### Technical Documentation

- Complete API documentation available at `/docs`
- System architecture details in project documentation
- Error logs available through configured monitoring

### Configuration Updates

- Business rule modifications require code changes
- Pipeline routing adjustments configurable via environment variables
- Custom field mapping requires development updates

**Implementation Support:** Contact your technical team for assistance with setup, configuration, or customization requirements.

## How It Works

### 1. Voice Call Processing

When someone calls your Bland.ai voice agent:

- The call is automatically recorded and transcribed
- At the end of the call, Bland.ai sends the transcript to your system
- The AI analyzes the conversation and extracts key information

### 2. Information Extraction

The AI automatically finds and extracts:

- **Contact Info**: Name, phone, email, company
- **Project Details**: Type of event, location, dates, requirements  
- **Service Needs**: Number of units, ADA requirements, power/water needs
- **Budget Information**: Any budget mentioned during the call

### 3. Smart Classification

Based on the extracted information, the system classifies each lead:

- **Services Team**: Local projects, small events, porta potty rentals
- **Logistics Team**: Large events, long-distance projects, specialty trailers
- **General Leads**: Needs human review or doesn't fit standard categories
- **Disqualified**: Wrong numbers, spam, or non-relevant calls

### 4. Automatic HubSpot Sync

For qualified leads, the system:

- Creates a new contact in HubSpot with extracted information
- Creates a deal in the appropriate pipeline
- Assigns to the correct team based on classification
- Adds notes with the call summary and AI reasoning

## Web Dashboard

Access your dashboard at: `http://localhost:8000`

The dashboard shows:

- Recent call activity and classifications
- Lead conversion statistics  
- Team performance metrics
- System health and API status

## API Endpoints

## Configuring Bland.ai Integration

1. **Set Webhook URL** in your Bland.ai dashboard:

   ```
   https://your-domain.com/api/v1/webhooks/voice
   ```

2. **Configure Voice Agent** with these variables in Bland.ai:
   - `service_address` - Delivery location
   - `contact_name` - Customer name
   - `contact_email` - Customer email
   - `units_needed` - Number of units required
   - `project_category` - Type of project/event

- Local construction projects
- Porta potty rentals
- Projects within 3 hours of service hubs

### Logistics Team  

- Large events (20+ units or 7+ specialty trailers)
- Long-distance projects (over 3 hours from hubs)
- Disaster relief projects
- Complex multi-location deployments

### General Leads

- Projects needing human review
- Incomplete information from calls
- Special requirements not fitting standard categories

## Getting Help

### Technical Support

- Check the API documentation at `/docs`
- Review system logs for error details
- Verify all API keys are properly configured

### Business Rules

- Contact your account manager to adjust classification rules
- Request pipeline/team routing changes
- Discuss custom field mapping requirements

## Security Notes

- Keep your `.env` file secure and never share API keys
- Use HTTPS in production environments
