- **Leads**: Standard lead pipeline entries
- **Disqualify**: Non-viable opportunities

## Implementation Details

### Marvin AI Integration

The system uses Marvin AI functions for intelligent data extraction:

```python
@marvin.fn
def extract_contact_properties_from_transcript(transcript: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Extract contact information from voice call transcript.
    Handles natural language processing to identify:
    - Names and contact details
    - Company information
    - Location data
    - Communication preferences
    """
```

### HubSpot Property Mapping

Extracted data automatically maps to HubSpot models:

- `HubSpotContactProperties`: Contact management
- `HubSpotLeadProperties`: Deal and project tracking
- Automatic field validation and type conversion

### Processing Flow

1. **Webhook Reception**: Bland.ai sends voice call data
2. **Transcript Extraction**: System extracts transcript from webhook payload
3. **AI Processing**: Marvin AI analyzes transcript and extracts structured data
4. **Classification**: AI or rule-based classification determines lead type
5. **HubSpot Integration**: Extracted data syncs to HubSpot CRM
6. **Result Storage**: Processing results stored in MongoDB
7. **Response**: Comprehensive processing results returned

## Configuration

### AI Processing Toggle

```python
# Enable/disable AI processing (default: enabled)
use_ai_processing: bool = True
```

### Fallback Mechanism

- Automatic fallback to legacy processing if AI fails
- Maintains system reliability and uptime
- Preserves existing functionality

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Marvin AI Configuration
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
MARVIN_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR
MARVIN_VERBOSE=false
```
