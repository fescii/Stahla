# Pricing Agent - Status Update

**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Version:** Aligned with Pricing Agent V9 Brief

## Overview

This document provides a status update on the implementation of the Real-time Pricing Agent, comparing progress against the original 2-week timeline outlined for its core development.

Overall, the core infrastructure, services, and API endpoints for the Pricing Agent are **implemented and functional**. The system successfully synchronizes data from Google Sheets, calculates distances via Google Maps, caches relevant data in Redis, and generates quotes based on the implemented logic via secure webhooks.

Work corresponding to the planned **Week 1 and Week 2** deliverables is largely complete, with some refinements and final verification pending.

## Status vs. Timeline

### Week 1: Pricing Agent Core Logic & Setup (Goal: Implement core logic & infrastructure)

*   **1. Setup & Configuration:**
    *   **Redis Integration:** `COMPLETE` (RedisService implemented and used for caching).
    *   **Google Sheets API Access:** `COMPLETE` (Auth and sync logic implemented).
    *   **Google Maps API Access:** `COMPLETE` (Client integrated in LocationService).
    *   **Pricing Module Structure:** `COMPLETE` (Services created in `app/services/quote/`, `app/services/location/`).
    *   **Pydantic Models:** `COMPLETE` (Models defined in `app/models/quote.py`, `app/models/location.py`).
    *   *Deliverable Status:* **COMPLETE**. Configured environment and module structure are in place.
*   **2. Google Sheet Sync:**
    *   **Polling Logic:** `COMPLETE` (Sync runs on startup and periodically).
    *   **Parsing & Caching:** `COMPLETE` (Parses products, generators, branches, config; stores in Redis `pricing:catalog`, `stahla:branches`).
    *   **Error Handling/Logging:** `COMPLETE` (Implemented within `sync.py`).
    *   *Deliverable Status:* **COMPLETE**. Functional sync mechanism is operational.
*   **3. Core Pricing Logic (Part 1):**
    *   **QuoteService Structure:** `COMPLETE`.
    *   **Base Trailer Rental Logic:** `IMPLEMENTED` (Calculates based on type, days, usage; uses Redis data). *Needs final verification against all business rule nuances.* 
    *   **Trailer Extras Logic:** `IMPLEMENTED` (Calculates pump out, water fill, cleaning, restocking based on product data). *Needs verification.* 
    *   *Deliverable Status:* **LARGELY COMPLETE**. Initial QuoteService covers base rental and extras. Unit tests are recommended as a next step.

*   **Performance Testing - Iteration 1:** `DEFERRED`. Deferred pending finalization of all calculation logic.

### Week 2: Pricing Agent Delivery, Advanced Logic & Webhook (Goal: Complete logic, implement webhooks)

*   **1. Core Pricing Logic (Part 2 - Delivery & Generators):**
    *   **Nearest Branch Logic:** `COMPLETE` (Implemented in LocationService, uses Redis cache).
    *   **Google Maps API Call:** `COMPLETE` (Implemented in LocationService).
    *   **Redis Caching for Maps:** `COMPLETE` (Implemented in LocationService).
    *   **Delivery Cost Calculation:** `IMPLEMENTED` (Includes base fee, per-mile rate, free tier logic, and applies seasonal multipliers). *Requires final verification of rule parsing from the Config sheet.* 
    *   **Generator Pricing Logic:** `IMPLEMENTED` (Calculates based on type and duration tiers). *Needs verification against rules.*
    *   *Deliverable Status:* **LARGELY COMPLETE**. `build_quote` method covers all components. Unit tests are recommended.
*   **2. Webhook Implementation (Two-Stage):**
    *   **/webhook/location_lookup:** `COMPLETE` (Accepts location, triggers async task, returns 202).
    *   **/webhook/quote:** `COMPLETE` (API Key auth, accepts request, calls service, handles errors, returns response).
    *   *Deliverable Status:* **COMPLETE**. Webhooks are functional.
*   **3. Integration Testing (Functional):** `PARTIALLY COMPLETE`. Testing via HTTP client files (`rest/quote.http`, `rest/location.http`) has been performed, validating basic functionality and data flow. More comprehensive scenario testing is needed.

*   **Performance Testing & Refinements - Iteration 2:** `DEFERRED`. Deferred pending final logic verification.

## Summary & Next Steps (Pricing Agent Specific)

The backend implementation for the Pricing Agent, covering the scope of Week 1 and Week 2 of the original plan, is functionally complete. The system can sync data, calculate distances, apply basic pricing rules including seasonal multipliers, and serve quotes via secure API endpoints.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1.  **Logic Verification:** Rigorously test and verify the calculations in `app/services/quote/quote.py` against all specific business rules, edge cases, and pricing appendices (A & B).
2.  **Config Sheet Finalization:** Ensure the Google Sheet `Config` tab accurately contains all required data points for delivery rules (base fee, per-mile rate, free threshold) and *all* seasonal tiers (Standard, Premium, Premium Plus, etc.) with correct keys/formats. Verify the parsing logic in `app/services/quote/sync.py` correctly handles this finalized structure.
3.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Expand functional testing to cover a wider range of scenarios (different dates, durations, locations, extras combinations).
4.  **Performance Testing:** Conduct planned performance tests once logic is fully verified.
