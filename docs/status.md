# Stahla AI SDR Project Status Report
**Date:** May 5, 2025
**Version:** Aligned with PRD v1 + Pricing Agent v9 Brief

## 1. Executive Summary

This document details the current status of the Stahla AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) project, now including the integrated **Real-time Pricing Agent** functionality and the backend structure for an **Operational Dashboard**. The initiative automates lead handling (voice, email, web forms) using AI, integrates with HubSpot, and now provides **instant quoting capabilities** during SDR interactions via secure webhooks. The system addresses inefficiencies, reduces response times (including quote generation), improves data quality, and aims to increase lead conversion. Core SDR v1 functionalities and the Pricing Agent backend are implemented. Critical next steps involve refining HubSpot integration, finalizing pricing/delivery rule implementation from sheets, completing dashboard features, and comprehensive testing.

## 2. Business Problem & Objectives

**Problem:** (Original problem statement remains valid). Additionally, the lack of real-time quoting during initial SDR calls caused delays and potential drop-offs.

**V1 Objectives:**
*   **Response Time:** Achieve a median first response time of <15 seconds for all inbound channels.
*   **Data Completeness:** Ensure ≥95% completeness for critical fields (lead type, product, duration, location, stalls, budget) on new HubSpot Contact and Deal records.
*   **Routing Accuracy:** Attain ≥90% accuracy in routing leads to the correct Stahla business unit pipeline.
*   **Conversion Rate:** Increase the qualified-lead-to-quote conversion rate by +20% within three months post-launch.
*   **Sales Confidence:** Achieve a ≥4/5 rating from sales representatives regarding the completeness and accuracy of information provided before quoting.
*   **Pricing Agent Speed:** Achieve <500ms P95 latency for the `/webhook/quote` endpoint.
*   **Quoting Accuracy:** Ensure quotes generated match the rules defined in the Google Sheets pricing tables.

## 3. Solution Architecture Overview (v1 + Pricing)

The solution comprises a FastAPI backend orchestrating:

1.  **AI Intake Agent:** (As previously described).
2.  **Multi-Channel Webhooks:** Includes endpoints for forms, email, voice, and now **`/pricing/quote`** and **`/pricing/location_lookup`**.
3.  **Classification & Routing Engine:** (As previously described).
4.  **HubSpot Integration:** (As previously described).
5.  **Real-time Pricing Agent (Integrated):**
    *   **Quote Service (`app/services/quote/quote.py`):** Calculates prices based on cached data.
    *   **Location Service (`app/services/location/location.py`):** Handles Google Maps distance calculation and caching.
    *   **Sheet Sync Service (`app/services/quote/sync.py`):** Periodically fetches pricing rules, config, and branch locations from Google Sheets.
    *   **Redis Cache (`app/services/redis/redis.py`):** Stores pricing catalog, branch list, config, and map results.
6.  **Operational Dashboard Backend:**
    *   **API (`/api/v1/dashboard`):** Exposes endpoints for monitoring and limited management.
    *   **Service (`app/services/dash/dashboard.py`):** Provides logic for retrieving dashboard data and executing management actions.
    *   **Background Tasks (`app/services/dash/background.py`):** Handles asynchronous logging and metric updates to Redis.
7.  **Automated Communication:** (As previously described).
8.  **Configuration & Monitoring:** Includes pricing agent keys, sheet ranges, etc. Logfire integration and health checks remain.

## 4. Core Technology Stack

*   **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
*   **CRM Integration:** HubSpot API
*   **Voice AI:** Bland.ai API
*   **Language Model (Optional):** Marvin AI
*   **Data Validation:** Pydantic
*   **Logging & Observability:** Logfire, Health Endpoints
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Caching:** Redis
*   **Geo-Services:** Google Maps Distance Matrix API
*   **Data Source:** Google Sheets API

## 5. Current Implementation Status

Foundational components, primary SDR workflows, the Pricing Agent backend, and the Dashboard API structure are implemented:

*   **API Infrastructure:** All core v1 endpoints, including pricing and dashboard routes, are defined.
*   **Intake & Classification:** Functionality remains as previously described.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** Basic functionality implemented; requires refinement.
*   **Bland.ai Integration:** Functionality remains as previously described.
*   **Email Processing:** Functionality remains as previously described.
*   **Pricing Agent:** Services, dynamic configuration loading (sheets -> Redis), caching, and API endpoints are implemented. Core calculation logic uses data from cache.
*   **Dashboard Backend:** API endpoints, service layer, and background task functions are implemented. Overview endpoint fetches data from Redis.
*   **Configuration & Models:** Environment loading and Pydantic models cover all components.
*   **Logging:** Basic Logfire integration and background logging to Redis for dashboard are in place.

## 6. Key Implemented Features (v1 Scope + Pricing)

*   Multi-channel lead ingestion (Web Form, Email, Voice).
*   Automated lead classification (Services, Logistics, Leads, Disqualify) via configurable rules/AI.
*   Automated creation/updating of HubSpot Contact and Deal records.
*   Automated voice follow-up calls (via Bland.ai) for incomplete web form submissions.
*   Automated email replies requesting missing information for incomplete email leads.
*   Generation of internal email handoff notifications to sales teams.
*   Initial implementation of HubSpot pipeline and owner assignment logic.
*   Structured application logging via Logfire.
*   Real-time quote generation via `/webhook/quote`.
*   Asynchronous location distance lookup and caching via `/webhook/location_lookup`.
*   Dynamic loading of pricing rules, config, and branches from Google Sheets.
*   Redis caching for pricing catalog, branches, config, and map results.
*   API Key security for pricing webhooks.
*   Backend API for operational dashboard (monitoring & management).
*   Asynchronous logging/metric updates for dashboard data.

## 7. Implemented Core Workflows (v1 + Pricing)

1.  **Web Form Submission:** Form data received -> Completeness check -> [If Incomplete: Bland.ai callback initiated -> Transcript received] -> Classification -> HubSpot record creation/update -> Sales notification.
2.  **Direct Inbound Call:** Call answered by Bland.ai -> Data collection via dynamic questioning -> Transcript received -> Classification -> HubSpot record creation/update -> Sales notification.
3.  **Inbound Email:** Email received -> Parsing & completeness check -> [If Incomplete: Auto-reply sent] -> Classification -> HubSpot record creation/update -> Sales notification.
4.  **Real-time Quoting:** External system calls `/pricing/location_lookup` (optional early call) -> External system calls `/pricing/quote` with details -> API calculates quote using cached data -> API returns quote response.
5.  **Dashboard Interaction:** Frontend (not implemented) calls `/dashboard/...` endpoints -> API retrieves data from Redis or triggers actions (sync, cache clear).
