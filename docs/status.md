# Stahla AI SDR Project Status Report
**Date:** April 16, 2025  
**Version:** Aligned with PRD v1

## 1. Executive Summary

This document details the current status of the Stahla AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) project. The initiative aims to automate and optimize the handling of inbound leads across multiple channels (voice, email, web forms) by implementing an intelligent backend system. This system leverages AI for interaction and classification, integrates deeply with HubSpot CRM, and provides sales representatives with enriched, actionable data, thereby addressing critical inefficiencies in the current manual process, reducing response times, improving data quality, and ultimately increasing lead conversion rates. The core functionalities for v1 are largely implemented, with key integrations operational. Critical next steps focus on refining HubSpot integration specifics (dynamic IDs, call data), enhancing data capture logic, finalizing notification content, and comprehensive testing to meet v1 performance goals.

## 2. Business Problem & Objectives

**Problem:** Stahla's current manual lead intake process suffers from significant delays, inconsistent data capture, and inaccurate routing across its business units (Services, Logistics, Leads). This results in poor customer experiences, lost sales opportunities (estimated 30% paid traffic), wasted marketing spend, and reduced operational efficiency due to manual data entry and lack of uniform data for delivery teams.

**V1 Objectives:**
*   **Response Time:** Achieve a median first response time of <15 seconds for all inbound channels.
*   **Data Completeness:** Ensure ≥95% completeness for critical fields (lead type, product, duration, location, stalls, budget) on new HubSpot Contact and Deal records.
*   **Routing Accuracy:** Attain ≥90% accuracy in routing leads to the correct Stahla business unit pipeline.
*   **Conversion Rate:** Increase the qualified-lead-to-quote conversion rate by +20% within three months post-launch.
*   **Sales Confidence:** Achieve a ≥4/5 rating from sales representatives regarding the completeness and accuracy of information provided before quoting.

## 3. Solution Architecture Overview (v1)

The v1 solution comprises a FastAPI backend orchestrating several key components:

1.  **AI Intake Agent:** Utilizes Bland.ai for handling inbound voice calls and initiating automated follow-up calls for incomplete web forms. Employs dynamic, context-aware questioning strategies. Leverages LLM capabilities (via Marvin, optionally) for parsing inbound emails.
2.  **Multi-Channel Webhooks:** Dedicated API endpoints (`/api/v1/webhooks/...`) receive data from web forms, emails (via forwarding), and Bland.ai voice interactions.
3.  **Classification & Routing Engine:** A core service (`app/services/classification.py`) analyzes lead data using configurable business rules (`classification_rules.py`) or AI (`marvin_classification.py`) to determine the appropriate category (Services, Logistics, Leads, Disqualify).
4.  **HubSpot Integration:** A dedicated service (`app/services/hubspot.py`) interacts with the HubSpot API to create/update Contact and Deal records, populate standard and custom properties, associate call data (summaries/recordings), and assign records to the correct pipeline and owner (via round-robin).
5.  **Automated Communication:** Services manage automated email replies for incomplete email submissions (`app/services/email.py`) and trigger internal handoff notifications upon successful processing.
6.  **Configuration & Monitoring:** System behavior is managed via environment variables (`.env`) and Pydantic settings (`app/core/config.py`). Observability is facilitated through Logfire integration and dedicated health check endpoints (`/api/v1/health`).

## 4. Core Technology Stack

*   **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
*   **CRM Integration:** HubSpot API
*   **Voice AI:** Bland.ai API
*   **Language Model (Optional):** Marvin AI

## 5. Current Implementation Status

The foundational components and primary workflows of the AI SDR system are implemented and operational:

*   **API Infrastructure:** All core v1 API endpoints under `/api/v1/` (health, classification, webhooks) are defined and functional.
*   **Intake Channels:**
    *   Web form webhook successfully receives data and triggers classification or Bland.ai callbacks based on data completeness.
    *   Email webhook receives forwarded emails, performs initial parsing, and triggers auto-replies or classification.
    *   Bland.ai webhook successfully receives call transcripts and associated metadata.
*   **Classification Engine:** The service correctly processes lead data through either the rule-based or Marvin AI path, yielding classification outputs.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** Basic Contact and Deal creation/update functionality is implemented. Initial logic for pipeline/owner assignment exists but requires refinement (see TODOs).
*   **Bland.ai Integration:** Service successfully initiates outbound follow-up calls and processes inbound webhook data.
*   **Email Processing:** Service handles parsing, auto-reply generation for missing data, and triggers internal handoff notifications.
*   **Configuration & Models:** Environment variable loading and Pydantic data models are fully implemented.
*   **Logging:** Basic Logfire integration is in place.

## 6. Key Implemented Features (v1 Scope)

*   Multi-channel lead ingestion (Web Form, Email, Voice).
*   Automated lead classification (Services, Logistics, Leads, Disqualify) via configurable rules/AI.
*   Automated creation/updating of HubSpot Contact and Deal records.
*   Automated voice follow-up calls (via Bland.ai) for incomplete web form submissions.
*   Automated email replies requesting missing information for incomplete email leads.
