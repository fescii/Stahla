# Project Status Report: Stahla AI SDR + Pricing & Dashboard

**Date:** May 8, 2025
**Version:** Aligned with PRD v1 + Pricing Agent v9 Brief + Dashboard Backend v1

## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the current status of the Stahla AI Sales Development Representative (SDR) project. Significant progress has been made, with the core AI SDR functionality (lead intake, classification, basic HubSpot integration) now complemented by the integrated **Real-time Pricing Agent** and the backend infrastructure for an **Operational Dashboard**.

The system automatically handles leads from various channels (web forms, email, voice), classifies them using configurable rules or AI, and interacts with HubSpot. The Pricing Agent allows for instant quote generation via secure API calls, using dynamically updated rules fetched from Google Sheets and cached in Redis. The Dashboard backend provides secure (JWT authenticated) endpoints for monitoring system health, viewing error logs, and performing basic management tasks like cache clearing and manual data syncs. User authentication and management capabilities are now integrated.

Key backend components are implemented. Immediate next steps involve finalizing the detailed pricing and delivery rule logic based on the Google Sheets configuration, developing the dashboard frontend UI, completing the HubSpot integration linkage against the client's instance, finalizing the Bland.ai pathway definition, and conducting thorough end-to-end testing.

## 2. Detailed Status by Component

### 2.1. Core AI SDR Functionality
*   **Lead Intake:** Webhooks for web forms, email (via SendGrid/IMAP setup assumed), and voice (Bland.ai) are functional.
*   **Classification Engine:** Logic for classifying leads (Services, Logistics, Leads, Disqualify) based on configurable rules or AI (Marvin/OpenAI) is implemented.
*   **Basic Workflow:** Automated creation/updating of HubSpot contacts/deals and internal email notifications are functional but require final configuration checks against the client's specific HubSpot setup.

### 2.2. Real-time Pricing Agent (`app/services/quote/`, `app/services/location/`)
*   **Goal:** Provide instant, accurate quotes via API based on dynamic rules.
*   **Status:** Backend services and API endpoints are implemented and functional.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Sheet Sync Service (`sync.py`):** Runs periodically (every 5 minutes) and on startup to fetch product pricing, generator pricing, branch locations, and configuration (delivery rules, seasonal multipliers) from the configured Google Sheets (`settings.GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`) and caches them in Redis. Handles header rows correctly.
    *   **Redis Cache (`redis.py`):** Stores the fetched pricing catalog, branch list, and configuration data for fast access. Also caches results from Google Maps API calls (with a 24-hour TTL).
    *   **Location Service (`location.py`):**
        *   **Input:** Takes a delivery address string.
        *   **Processing:** Loads branch addresses from Redis cache. Calculates driving distance/duration from the nearest branch using Google Maps Distance Matrix API (`settings.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`). Results are cached in Redis.
        *   **Output:** Returns nearest branch details and distance/duration. The `/webhook/location_lookup` endpoint triggers this asynchronously.
    *   **Quote Service (`quote.py`):**
        *   **Input:** Takes a `QuoteRequest` (delivery location, trailer type, start date, rental days, usage type, extras list).
        *   **Processing:** Retrieves pricing catalog from Redis; gets delivery distance via Location Service; calculates trailer cost applying duration tiers and seasonal multipliers; calculates delivery cost applying distance rules and seasonal multipliers; calculates costs for extras (generators, services); aggregates line items.
        *   **Output:** Returns a `QuoteResponse` (line items, subtotal, delivery tier description, notes).
*   **API Endpoints (`/webhook/quote`, `/webhook/location_lookup`):** Functional and secured via API Key (`settings.PRICING_WEBHOOK_API_KEY`) sent in the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.

### 2.3. Dashboard Backend (`app/services/dash/`, `app/api/v1/endpoints/dash/`)
*   **Goal:** Provide monitoring and management capabilities for administrators.
*   **Status:** Backend API endpoints and supporting services are implemented. Requires frontend UI development.
*   **Storage:**
    *   **MongoDB:** Uses a MongoDB database (configured via `MONGO_*` settings) to store persistent operational logs/reports (e.g., errors, successful operations) in a `reports` collection. This allows for historical analysis and detailed error viewing.
    *   **Redis:** Used for simple, fast-access counters (e.g., total quote requests, API calls) and caching (pricing data, map results).
*   **Authentication:** Dashboard endpoints require JWT authentication. Authorized users (initially created via `.env` settings) log in via the `/auth/token` endpoint using their email and password to obtain a JWT. This token must then be included in subsequent requests either in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, an `x-access-token` header, or an `x-access-token` cookie.
*   **Key Endpoints & Functions (requires authentication):**
    *   `GET /dashboard/overview`: Retrieves aggregated data: report summaries from MongoDB, counters from Redis, recent error logs from MongoDB, and placeholder status for cache/external services.
    *   `GET /dashboard/errors`: Retrieves a list of recent error logs stored in MongoDB, filterable by error type, with pagination (limit).
    *   `POST /dashboard/sync/trigger`: Allows an authenticated user to manually trigger the Google Sheet synchronization process.
    *   `GET /dashboard/cache/search?pattern=...`: Searches Redis cache keys.
    *   `GET /dashboard/cache/item?key=...`: Retrieves a specific Redis cache item's value and TTL.
    *   `POST /dashboard/cache/clear/item`: Clears a specific key from Redis cache.
    *   `POST /dashboard/cache/clear/pricing`: Clears the main pricing catalog cache from Redis.
    *   `POST /dashboard/cache/clear/maps`: Clears Google Maps distance results from Redis cache based on a location pattern.

### 2.4. User Authentication & Management (`app/services/auth/`, `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth/`)
*   **Status:** Implemented.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Password hashing using `bcrypt`.
    *   JWT generation and validation for securing endpoints.
    *   User storage in MongoDB (`users` collection) with fields for email, name, hashed password, role (admin, member, dev), and active status.
    *   API endpoints for:
        *   `/auth/token`: User login (email/password) to obtain JWT.
        *   `/auth/me`: Get current logged-in user details.
        *   `/users/` (Admin only): Create, read (list, by ID), update, delete users.
    *   Initial admin user creation on application startup based on `.env` variables.

### 2.5. HubSpot Integration (`app/services/hubspot.py`)
*   **Status:** Core logic for API interaction (creating/updating contacts and deals) is implemented. The service is ready for configuration and testing against the client's specific HubSpot instance. Final mapping of application data fields to HubSpot properties and configuration of pipeline/stage IDs in the `.env` file are required.

### 2.6. Bland.ai Integration (`app/services/bland.py`)
*   **Status:** Core logic for initiating calls and processing webhook responses (call completion, transcript analysis) is implemented. The definition of the dynamic conversation pathway (`assets/call.json`) is pending finalization of the Pricing Agent functionality, as the call flow may need to query the quote/location API during the conversation. The current pathway uses placeholder logic.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Pricing Logic Finalization:**
    *   **Critical:** Rigorously verify all calculation steps in `app/services/quote/quote.py` against the official pricing appendices and business rules.
    *   **Critical:** Finalize the structure and content of the `Config` tab in Google Sheets for Delivery Rules and all Seasonal Tiers; verify parsing logic in `app/services/quote/sync.py`.
2.  **HubSpot Integration:** Configure pipeline/stage IDs in `.env`; map data fields; perform end-to-end testing with the client's HubSpot account.
3.  **Bland.ai Pathway:** Update `assets/call.json` with the final conversation flow, incorporating calls to the pricing API as needed.
4.  **Dashboard Frontend:** Develop the user interface.
5.  **Dashboard Backend Enhancements:** Implement actual logic for cache statistics and external service status checks (currently placeholders).
6.  **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests.
7.  **Logging & Monitoring:** Refine logging based on testing feedback.

## 4. Conclusion

The project backend is substantially complete, integrating the AI SDR core, the Real-time Pricing Agent, and a secure Dashboard API. The focus now shifts to precise configuration based on client data (HubSpot, Google Sheets rules), frontend development for the dashboard, and thorough testing to ensure accuracy and robustness before deployment.
