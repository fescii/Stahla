# CLASSIFICATION RULES FOR STAHLACALLS

# IMPORTANT: The canonical source for all call flow, lead type, process, and subflow logic is call.md in the project root.
# All classification rules and logic in this file MUST match the current instructions and flow in call.md.
# If you update call.md, you must update this file to match, and vice versa.
