**Instructions:**
1.  Create a file named `classification_service.py` inside the `app/services/` directory.
2.  Paste this code into it.
3.  **Important:** The `_apply_placeholder_rules` method contains very basic example logic. This **must be replaced** with the actual classification mechanism (e.g., calling Marvin, using another LLM via API, implementing a more complex rules engine, or loading a machine learning model
