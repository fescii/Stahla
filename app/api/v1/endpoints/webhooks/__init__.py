# app/api/v1/endpoints/webhooks/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'webhooks' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import routers here if needed for simpler imports elsewhere,
# but it's often clearer to import them directly in api.py.

# from .form import router as form_router
# from .hubspot import router as hubspot_router
# from .voice import router as voice_router
# from .email import router as email_router
