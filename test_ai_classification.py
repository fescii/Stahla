Agent: Hi, this is Sarah from Stahla Services. I'm calling regarding your inquiry about portable restroom rentals. Am I speaking with John?

User: Yes, this is John Peterson. Thanks for calling back so quickly.

Agent: Great! I understand you're looking for portable restrooms for an upcoming event. Can you tell me more about what you need?

User: Yes, we're having a company picnic on March 15th at Miller Park in Omaha. We're expecting about 150 people and need some porta potties for the day.

Agent: Perfect! So that's March 15th in Omaha with 150 guests. How many units were you thinking you'd need?

User: I'm not sure exactly. What would you recommend for 150 people?

Agent: For 150 people at a day event, I'd typically recommend 4-5 standard portable toilets. Would you need any ADA accessible units?

User: Yes, we should probably have at least one ADA unit to be safe.

Agent: Absolutely. So we're looking at 4 standard units plus 1 ADA accessible unit for March 15th at Miller Park. The event is just for the day, correct?

User: Yes, just one day. We'll need them delivered in the morning and picked up that evening.

Agent: Perfect. Do you have power available at the site for lighting in the units?

User: I think so, but I'd need to check with the park. Is that required?

Agent: It's not required, but it makes the units more comfortable for your guests. What's your contact email so I can send you a quote?

User: It's john.peterson@acmecompany.com

Agent: Great, and your company name is Acme Company?

User: Yes, that's right. Acme Manufacturing actually.

Agent: Perfect. I'll get a quote prepared for you for 4 standard units plus 1 ADA unit for March 15th delivery and pickup at Miller Park in Omaha. You should have that within the hour.

User: That sounds great. What's the ballpark cost?

Agent: For that package, you're looking at around $650 for the day including delivery and pickup.

User: That works within our budget. Thanks so much!

Agent: You're welcome! I'll get that quote out to you shortly.
